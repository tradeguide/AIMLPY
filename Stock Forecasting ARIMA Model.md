**Stock Forcasting ARIMA**
===

Predicting stock prices is a complex task and there is no guarantee of accuracy. 
However, you can use time series forecasting techniques like ARIMA or LSTM to make predictions based on historical stock prices data.

Here's an example of how you might use the statsmodels library in Python to make predictions using an ARIMA model:

```py
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the SBI stock price data into a pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_csv('SBI_stock_prices.csv')

# Convert the date column to a datetime index
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Plot the historical stock prices
plt.plot(df['Close'])
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Close Price')
plt.title('SBI Stock Price History')
plt.show()

# Train an ARIMA model on the stock price data
model = ARIMA(df['Close'], order=(1, 1, 1))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Make predictions for the next 5 days
predictions = model_fit.forecast(steps=5)[0]
print('Predicted Close Prices for the Next 5 Days:', predictions)
```
