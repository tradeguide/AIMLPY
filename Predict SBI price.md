# Price Prediction

a sample Python script that uses the scikit-learn library to make predictions for the stock prices of SBIN for the next 5 days:

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the data into a Pandas dataframe
data = pd.read_csv("SBIN.csv")

# Select the features and target
X = data.drop(["Date", "Adj Close"], axis=1)
y = data["Adj Close"]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance
error = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
print("Mean Absolute Error:", error)

# Make predictions for the next 5 days
last_5_days = X.tail(5)
future_predictions = model.predict(last_5_days)

# Print the predictions
print("Predictions for the next 5 days:", future_predictions)

```

Note that this script assumes that you have a file named SBIN.csv that contains the historical data for the stock prices of SBIN. The data should have the following columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume. The script uses the RandomForestRegressor class from the scikit-learn library to train the model, and the mean_absolute_error function to evaluate its performance.
