**Stock screener**
===

Screening and backtesting a stock involves analyzing its past performance and using that information to make predictions about its future performance. 
Here's a basic example of a Python script that can screen and backtest the stock of the State Bank of India (SBI):


```py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the SBI stock data into a pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_csv("SBI_stock_data.csv")

# Calculate the daily returns for the stock
df['returns'] = df['Close'].pct_change(1)

# Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the daily returns
mean_return = df['returns'].mean()
std_return = df['returns'].std()

# Define a function to simulate future returns
def simulate_returns(num_simulations, mean_return, std_return, num_days):
    simulated_returns = np.random.normal(mean_return, std_return, (num_simulations, num_days))
    return simulated_returns

# Simulate the returns for the next 5 days
num_simulations = 1000
num_days = 5
simulated_returns = simulate_returns(num_simulations, mean_return, std_return, num_days)

# Use the simulated returns to predict the future price of the stock
predicted_prices = df['Close'][-1] * (1 + simulated_returns).cumprod(axis=1)

# Plot the simulated prices and the predicted prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.plot(predicted_prices)
plt.xlabel('Simulation')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.title('Simulated Future Prices of SBI Stock')
plt.show()
```
